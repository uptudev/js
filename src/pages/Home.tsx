import React from "react";

const Home = () => {
    return <>
        <p>
            This is standard paragraph text. It is written in the DinaRemasterII font.
            If I keep typing it will eventually wrap and stretch the next line to fit.
            Somehow, this still works fine and seems to be completely stable.
            The next line is this shit
        </p>
    </>;
  };
  
  export default Home;
