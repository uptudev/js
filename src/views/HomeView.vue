        <p class="text">I have been coding in some aspect for over a decade now as a hobbyist, but primarily using OOP languages like Java and C#. Recently I've forayed into web development, and have taken to it quickly with the ease of Vue.js 3 and its Composition API.</p>

            <p>A more comprehensive list of languages I have <strong>amateur</strong> experience in is as follows:</p>
            <br><hr class="hr"><br>
            <ul class="small">
                <li>
                    <strong>Java</strong> - <em>10 years;</em> my first programming language learned. Little uptu thought that Java was going to overtake C/C++ because of that sweet sweet JVM.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <strong>C#</strong> - <em>~7 years;</em> I wanted to try out Visual Studio (at the time I was unaware of the fledgling VS Code and had used Eclipse previously), and decided learning C# would be a good intro to the C family. I quickly learned that I had already learned C# well beforehand by learning Java, with C# being a more syntactically stripped-down version of the same general underlying concepts, felling more like Java than C/C++. I have made a few Unity projects, and coding in it practically comes as a second nature coming from a Java background.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Python</strong> - <em>~5 years;</em> taught me how much I took curly-brace syntax for granted with other languages! I have a love-hate relationship with the language, as although the lack of braces makes scripting easier and faster in it, I find myself making indentation errors often that become crippling where they wouldn't be in other languages.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <strong>HTML/CSS/TS</strong> - <em>~5 years;</em> the trinity of front-end web dev. I learned bits and pieces of HTML around 15 years ago, with markup languages being rather simple to learn. I learned CSS primarily to modify a stylesheet on a subreddit I moderated, which I was migrating to use Naut with some tweaks. I have less experience with JavaScript, although I have been actively learning TypeScript recently to code scripts on this website, primarily using Vue.js as a framework.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bash</strong> - <em>~5 years;</em> shell scripts can be immensely useful for automating many aspects of Linux development, and I personally have a deploy script ready to go on my desktop, along with many other small utility scripts. I am most familiar with the Debian family of distros and their commands.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lua</strong> - <em>~1 month;</em> I learned it on a weekend to make <a href="https://github.com/uptudev/hamisNice">a mod</a> for one of my favourite games, Noita. I can't even say I know the language, as it was a trial-by-fire where I was too busy trying to figure out Noita's poorly-documented mod API to actually note anything about it otherwise. Unfortunately the aforementioned API issues left a bad taste in my mouth, and I haven't touched Lua since.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Go</strong> - <em>Learning;</em> I originally wanted to learn C++ as my next language after learning TypeScript, however I've noticed Go getting some traction as of recent as a potential successor to C++, and may look to it as a possible replacement for most purposes.
                </li><br>
                <li>
                    <strong>Rust</strong> - <em>Learning;</em> I'm also looking into learning Rust instead, as it provides some nifty low-level support, and polling has shown that most programmers love Rust more than their own mothers.
